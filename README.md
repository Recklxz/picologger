# picologger

# Description:
In this project, a Raspberry Pi Pico is converted into a Rubber Ducky-style USB device that functions as a keylogger. Using Ducky Script, the device executes pre-defined keystroke commands, simulating keyboard input to gather and log data in real-time. This setup demonstrates the Raspberry Pi Pico's potential as a compact, programmable HID (Human Interface Device), highlighting security concerns in USB devices while showcasing offensive cybersecurity techniques and the impact of HID-based attacks.
